# Codex plugin

Concord Loom ships a Codex plugin containing the `design-project-loops` skill.
The plugin provides a conversational layer over the deterministic CLI and
artifact contracts. It is not limited to software delivery: it can describe
any finite system of nested loops whose outcomes, evidence, authority, scope,
budgets, and terminal states can be made explicit.

The generic SDLC is an example binding, not the product boundary. Concord
Loom's repository uses the separately accepted 66-cycle development
configuration rooted at `steward-concordloom`. Observe, negotiate, bind,
execute, verify, publish, and evolve are the phases of each governed run.

## Recommended: install the skill directly

Ask Codex:

```text
Use $skill-installer to install
https://github.com/madduck-tech/concordloom/tree/v0.1.5/plugins/concordloom/skills/design-project-loops
```

Start a new Codex thread after installation. The skill will then be available
as `$design-project-loops`.

This is the simplest route in Orca and in other environments that provide the
built-in `$skill-installer`. It installs only the onboarding skill; Concord
Loom does not currently require a plugin app or MCP server.

## Optional: install the full plugin from the GitHub marketplace

Pin the marketplace to the release tag, confirm that Codex can see it, then
install the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add concordloom/concordloom --ref v0.1.5
codex plugin marketplace list
codex plugin add concordloom@concordloom
```

The list must contain `concordloom`. The final command should report
`Added plugin 'concordloom' from marketplace 'concordloom'`.

If `marketplace add` reports success but the list does not contain
`concordloom`, remove only that incomplete local snapshot and add it again:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace remove concordloom
codex plugin marketplace add concordloom/concordloom --ref v0.1.5
codex plugin marketplace list
codex plugin add concordloom@concordloom
```

If the marketplace disappears again, your host is replacing Codex's
`config.toml`. Do not keep retrying or edit that generated file by hand. Use
the direct skill installation above.

After a successful plugin installation, start a new Codex thread so it loads
the installed skill.

The marketplace entry resolves the repository-local
`plugins/concordloom` bundle. Inspect
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and
`plugins/concordloom/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` before installing if your
environment requires a manual trust review.

For local plugin development, add the checkout as a marketplace source and
install the same `concordloom@concordloom` identity according to the current
Codex plugin CLI help.

## Use

You do not need to install the Concord Loom CLI first. Open the target
repository and ask Codex:

```text
Use $design-project-loops to onboard this repository safely. Analyze it
read-only, build a draft Atlas, and ask me only whether the map is correct.
```

The skill:

1. asks for the language and then the name to show in the conversation and
   Atlas;
2. runs bounded, read-only preflight;
3. if the CLI is missing, selects `pipx`, `uv tool`, or an isolated virtual
   environment and presents the exact pinned installation plan;
4. asks before changing the user environment or using the network;
5. reruns preflight and inspects the repository without executing its code;
6. builds an interactive draft Atlas before asking project questions;
7. asks only whether the map is correct and accepts ordinary-language
   corrections from any participant;
8. proposes a loop system and waits for exact acceptance;
9. compiles and validates the accepted contracts;
10. routes governed execution through run cards;
11. maintains the offline Atlas in the selected language; and
12. records evidence-backed evolution proposals without activating them.

The skill never uses system `pip`, never passes `--break-system-packages`, and
never installs silently.

The onboarding conversation does not expose role assignment, authority
references, temporary paths, digests, schemas, or raw CLI output. Those remain
internal implementation details. The person sees the Atlas first.
This rule covers every operator-facing scenario: installation, read-only
inspection, decisions, loop design, activation, Atlas, governed work, failures,
completion, and evolution. Raw CLI JSON and internal identifiers are supporting
technical details, not the conversation.

The same sequence applies outside software repositories. Adapters may provide
different evidence or executors, but they do not replace operator acceptance,
finite containment, bounded feedback, or candidate-bound verification.

## Fresh repositories

A repository with no Concord Loom binding enters a bounded read-only bootstrap:

- no product authority is inferred;
- no candidate or source mutation is authorized;
- discovery budgets remain explicit;
- the skill shows the draft Atlas before asking for corrections; and
- mutation remains blocked until the operator establishes the first accepted
  binding.

The bundled launcher reports an exact installation plan when the `concordloom`
CLI is unavailable. It prefers `pipx`, then `uv tool`, then a dedicated virtual
environment outside the repository. It does not silently download a package or
execute a repository-provided replacement.

## Authority boundary

The skill is not project execution authority by itself. Repository rules,
accepted artifacts, the active binding, and each run card remain controlling.
The operator chooses outcomes and disputed intent. The orchestrator chooses
files, tests, tools, models, and reviewers within those accepted boundaries.

Model output is a proposal until deterministic validation and required
authority accept it.

The active binding also governs Concord Loom's public surfaces. The bilingual
Pages site and its social-preview artwork are projections and communication
assets: they may explain accepted artifacts, but cannot create or change
authority. A Pages workflow is publication machinery, and a green build is not
proof of a live deployment without the separately authorized publication
receipt and deployed URL.

## Data and network policy

The core inspector is local and does not execute target code. A Codex session
may use model or connector services according to the user's environment.
Bind allowed content classes, providers, network access, and data egress in
policy; record the effective route in each attempt.

## Languages

English documents are canonical peers of the Russian files under `docs/ru/`.
The plugin's two operator references also have `.ru.md` siblings, and the
generic SDLC example includes `README.ru.md`. Translation must preserve command
names, identifiers, digests, epistemic states, and authority boundaries; it
must not turn a proposal or planned publication into an accepted or verified
fact.
